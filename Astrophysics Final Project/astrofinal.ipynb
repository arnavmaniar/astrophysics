    "This project is a gravitational simulation built using Pygame. It visualizes the interactions between the earth, moon, and spacecraft, under the influence of gravity. Users can create spacecraft and observe their trajectories as they orbit around planets or move through space. The simulation uses fundamental physics principles, including Newton's law of universal gravitation and centripetal acceleration, to accurately model the behavior of objects in space. Through interactive controls and real-time visual feedback, users can explore the dynamics of gravitational forces and visualize orbital mechanics."

    "\n",
    "This loop is primarily for event handling, however it also keeps the framerate of the game running smoothly. Pygame checks for any button presses or mouse clicks, and it calls the appropriate function as a result. For instance, if the clear button is pressed, it calls the `clear_objects` function, which removes all objects. If the left mouse button is pressed, it records the current mouse position (`event.pos`) as the temporary position (`temp_pos`). If the right mouse button is pressed and a temporary position is recorded, it calls the `create_ship` function to create a new spacecraft object (`new_object`) with the temporary position and the current mouse position. If the right mouse button is released, it appends the newly created spacecraft object (`new_object`) to the list of objects (`objects`).\n",
